# RJ11 

The RJ11 connector is used to connect the AC voltage sensor output to the emonTx V4, the emonTx V4 / emonPi V2 are also powered by the RJ11 connector. 

*Note: It's essential to use a 6P6C (6-pin, 6-connected) RJ11 cable, many telephone RJ11 cables only 6P4C (only 4-pins connected)*

## Pinout

1. GND
2. 5V
3. BIAS or 3.3V (if jumper SJ1 closed)
4. VS3
5. VS2
6. VS1 


# 5V Output

An emonBase can be powered using a open-ended USB-C connector wired into the 5V output terminals.

**Max: 5V 2A**
